I not only a fan of programming. I am a Software Engineer. 
I started programming at the age  

I actually live in Paris and I help companies developing, refactoring or maintaining their software.  

I believe that thanks to software engineering, machines can make our life better and easier. I also believe that we should not only create software but good ones. This means maintainable, scalable and reusable software. I am an advocate of [Steve McConnell Code Complete book](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670){:target="_blank"} and I believe software engineering is an art. 
I helped many companies build new software and improve existing ones and I discovered and learnt many new technologies during each experience.  

I do my best to improve my skills and learn new technologies. I am a curious fast learner who always tries new technologies and believes that they could be easily learnt and used to solve issues.  

I created this blog to keep track and summarize new things I learn about software development so I can easily refer to them later. I believe reflecting and writing down a summary of what I learn is the most important step in the learning process. [I discovered this interesting research about reflections in the learning process](https://sites.google.com/site/reflection4learning/why-reflect){:target="_blank"}.  

I also like to share my knowledge and learn from others. I am open minded and I easily accept challenges and changes.  

I hope that you will find my articles helpfull and interesting and I will appreciate your comments, feedbacks or emails to improve the content of this blog.
