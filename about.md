<br>
I am not just a fan of computers and programming. I am a Software Engineer.
<br>
<br>
Currently live in Paris and I help companies developing, refactoring or maintaining their software.
I am now a Full Stack Software Engineer at Target2Sell. A startup offering a SAAS AI Hyper-personalization platform for e-commerce websites. Built using the Java ecosystem technologies for the back-end and Vuej.s for the front end.
<br>
<br>
I believe that thanks to software engineering, machines can make our life better and easier. We should not create any software but maintainable, scalable and reusable ones. I am an advocate of [Steve McConnell Code Complete book](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670){:target="_blank"} and definetely think that software engineering is an art.
<br>
<br>
I helped many companies build new software and improve existing ones. I discovered and learnt different technologies throughout each experience.
I do my best to improve my skills and learn new technologies. I am a curious fast learner who always tries new technologies and believes that they could be easily learnt and used to solve issues.
<br>
<br>
I created this blog to keep track and summarize new things I learn about software development so I can easily refer to them later. I believe reflecting and writing down a summary of what I learn is the most important step in the learning process. If you are not convinced please read [this interesting research about the importance of reflections in the learning process](https://sites.google.com/site/reflection4learning/why-reflect){:target="_blank"}.
I like to share my knowledge and learn from others. I am open minded and easily accept challenges and changes.
<br>
<br>
Last but not least I am a chef in the heart. I love cooking, especially vegan food made from fresh and organically grown ingredients.
