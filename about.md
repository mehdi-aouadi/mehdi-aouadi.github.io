{% include typed-text-about.html %}

I am not just a fan of computers and programming. I am a Software Engineer.

Currently live in Paris and I help companies developing, refactoring or maintaining their software.

I am now a Full Stack Software Engineer at Target2Sell. A startup offering a SAAS AI Hyper-personalization platform for e-commerce websites. Built using the Java ecosystem technologies for the back-end and Vuej.s for the front end.

I believe that thanks to software engineering, machines can make our life better and easier. We should not create any software but maintainable, scalable and reusable ones. I am an advocate of [Steve McConnell Code Complete book](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670){:target="_blank"} and definetely think that software engineering is an art.

I helped many companies build new software and improve existing ones. I discovered and learnt different technologies throughout each experience.

I do my best to improve my skills and learn new technologies. I am a curious fast learner who always tries new technologies and believes that they could be easily learnt and used to solve issues.

I created this blog to keep track and summarize new things I learn about software development so I can easily refer to them later. I believe reflecting and writing down a summary of what I learn is the most important step in the learning process. If you are not convinced please read [this interesting research about the importance of reflections in the learning process](https://sites.google.com/site/reflection4learning/why-reflect){:target="_blank"}.

I like to share my knowledge and learn from others. I am open minded and easily accept challenges and changes.

I hope that you will find my articles helpfull and interesting and I will appreciate your comments, feedbacks or emails to improve the content of this blog.
