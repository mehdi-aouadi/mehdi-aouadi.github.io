I not only a fan of programming. I am a Software Engineer.  

I like computers because I appreciate their calculation power. They help me to solve complicated problems and I believe they make the human life better. Sometimes they are stupid but very fast and obedient. It all depends on the people manipulating them.   

I actually live in Paris and I work as a Full-stack Software Engineer consultant. I help companies developping, refactoring or maintaining their softwares.  

I created this blog to keep track and summarize the new things I learn about software development so I can easily refer to them later. I believe reflecting and writing down a summary of what I learn is the most important step in the learning process. [I found this interesting research about reflections in the learning process](https://sites.google.com/site/reflection4learning/why-reflect){:target="_blank"}.  

I also like to share my knowledge and learn from others. I am open minded and I easily accept challenges and changes.  

I hope that other people will find my articles helpfull or interesting and I will appreciate their comments, reviews or emails to improve the content of my blog.
